# Description: This program computes the slope of a line given 
# the end points of the line. The result is then printed to the screen.

# Initialize the end points.
startX = -2
startY = 1
endX = 5
endY = 36

# Compute the slope.
slope = (startY - endY) / (startX - endX)

# Print the results.
print("Starting point: (", startX, ",", startY, ")")
print("Ending point: (", endX, ",", endY, ")")
print("Slope of the line =", slope)
